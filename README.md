👋 Hello, I'm Nam-Mai TRAN, a Vietnamese born and raised now living and working in France. <br>
👩🏽‍💻 I’m passionate about both data engineering and teaching, and I'm looking to merge these interests into a single career. If I were not a data engineer, I would be opening a Vietnamese-style dessert shop owner (Chè), allowing me to spend my days indulging in my second hobby <br>

You can reach me at these below-mentioned adresses for any project collaboration or professional inquiries: <br>
