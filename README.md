👋 Hello! Welcome to my page <br>
👨‍💻 I'm Nam Mai. I'm particularly interested in Data Engineering and its subdomains: Analytics Engineering, MLOps, and Data Visualisation <br>
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ🍰🍔🍕 If I were not a data engineer, I would be a business owner selling Chè (Vietnamese-style dessert), making as profit as possible to travel around the world at the age of 45 <br>
